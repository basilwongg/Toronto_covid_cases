# Toronto_covid_cases

This this the repo for my research on Toronto COVID-19 cases, all the R codes are produced under "Scripts" folder, the "Output" folder contains the RMD file that is used to generate my full pdf report on the analysis. The .csv folder is the raw data from the Toronto Open Data Portal, it will be updated to the latest statistics every time we run the code. 

We aim to find out if the number of COVID-19 cases have a directly relationship to the Canada government policy making process. We specifically analyze the data based on the distribution of age group, episode date, source of infection and outcome. Results are all presented in the TOR_COVID.pdf under "Output" folder. All the references and packages used in this research are documented under references.bib
